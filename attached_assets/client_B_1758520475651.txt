Client B: I'm really frustrated. The last release introduced five critical bugs that impacted production.
CSD: We're deeply sorry — we've opened hotfix branches and are patching them now.
Client B: This is the third release with major regressions. Management is furious.
CSD: We understand; we're escalating to the engineering lead and will provide daily updates.
Client B: If this continues, we will consider contract termination at year-end.

Client B: Besides bugs, we had three escalations last month with no timely resolution.
CSD: We're improving our escalation process and adding senior support during remediation.
Client B: We expect immediate improvements — otherwise renewal is doubtful.

Client B: On a positive note, the new claims module did speed up a few workflows.
CSD: Glad that module helped; we want to replicate that success across modules.
