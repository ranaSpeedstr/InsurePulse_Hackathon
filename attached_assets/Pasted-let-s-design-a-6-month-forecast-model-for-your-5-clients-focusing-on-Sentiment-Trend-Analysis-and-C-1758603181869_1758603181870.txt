let’s design a 6-month forecast model for your 5 clients, focusing on Sentiment Trend Analysis and Churn Risk Probability. I’ll break it into:
1. Parameters Considered
Operational (Service Experience)
Avg_Response_Days (lower is better)
Avg_Delivery_Days (lower is better)
Escalations (lower is better)
Delivered vs Backlog (higher ratio → more satisfaction)
Support_Score (overall service quality)
Retention / Churn
Renewal Rate (%)
Policy Lapse Count
Competitor Quotes Requested
Risk Score (proxy for churn probability)
Sentiment Drivers
Derived from support interactions, escalations, delivery timelines → converted into % Positive / Neutral / Negative mentions.
Rule of thumb:
Support_Score ↑ → Positive mentions ↑
Escalations ↑ / Delivery Days ↑ → Negative mentions ↑
Backlog ↑ → Neutral/Negative mix.
2. Calculating Factors
Sentiment Trend Index (STI)
STI=(0.4×Support_Score)−(0.2×Avg_Response_Days)−(0.2×Avg_Delivery_Days)−(5×Escalations)+(3×Delivered/Backlog_Ratio)STI = (0.4 \times Support\_Score) - (0.2 \times Avg\_Response\_Days) - (0.2 \times Avg\_Delivery\_Days) - (5 \times Escalations) + (3 \times Delivered/Backlog\_Ratio)STI=(0.4×Support_Score)−(0.2×Avg_Response_Days)−(0.2×Avg_Delivery_Days)−(5×Escalations)+(3×Delivered/Backlog_Ratio)
Normalized 0–100. Higher = better sentiment trend.
Churn Risk Probability (CRP)
CRP=Base_Risk+(0.5×Policy_Lapse_Rate)+(0.3×Competitor_Quotes_Rate)−(0.4×Renewal_Rate_Improvement)CRP = Base\_Risk + (0.5 \times Policy\_Lapse\_Rate) + (0.3 \times Competitor\_Quotes\_Rate) - (0.4 \times Renewal\_Rate\_Improvement)CRP=Base_Risk+(0.5×Policy_Lapse_Rate)+(0.3×Competitor_Quotes_Rate)−(0.4×Renewal_Rate_Improvement)
Where Base_Risk = Risk Score / 100.
3. Forecast Assumptions (over 6 months)
Operational Efficiency: Response & Delivery improve 2–3% monthly if corrective measures applied.
Support Score: Increases 1–2 pts/month if escalations reduced.
Competitor Quotes: Drop 5–10%/month with improved satisfaction.
Renewal Rate: Improves ~1–2% per month if sentiment trends positive.
Risk Score: Drops 2–3 pts/month with consistent improvements.
4. Example Forecast Insights
Client A (High Risk, Low Renewal)
Baseline: Renewal 60%, Risk 92, Support_Score 81
Forecast: If response improves & backlog cleared →
Renewal ↑ to ~70–72% in 6 months
Risk ↓ to ~75
Sentiment shifts from Neutral-Negative → Balanced Positive
Client B (Moderate Risk)
Baseline: Renewal 65%, Risk 84, Support 70
Forecast:
Renewal ↑ to ~73%
Risk ↓ to ~70
Sentiment gradually improves, but remains volatile due to delivery delays.
Client C (Balanced, but high backlog)
Baseline: Renewal 75%, Risk 75, Backlog 5
Forecast:
If backlog reduced → Renewal ↑ to 82–83%
Risk ↓ to ~65
Sentiment shifts steadily to Positive.
Client D (Best Performer)
Baseline: Renewal 80%, Risk 68, Support 96
Forecast:
Renewal ↑ to ~88–90%
Risk ↓ to ~55
Sentiment remains Strong Positive, loyal client.
Client E (Good Renewal, Weak Ops)
Baseline: Renewal 85%, Risk 62, Support 65, Delivery 50 days
Forecast:
Renewal stable at 85–87%
Risk only slightly ↓ to ~58 unless delivery times improve
Sentiment risk: Complacency → Negative if delays persist.
5. Business Forecast Summary (6 months)
Client	Sentiment Trend (Now → 6M)	Renewal Rate (Now → 6M)	Risk Score (Now → 6M)	Churn Probability
A	Neutral/Negative → Balanced Positive	60% → 72%	92 → 75	High → Moderate
B	Neutral → Cautiously Positive	65% → 73%	84 → 70	Moderate → Lower
C	Neutral → Positive	75% → 83%	75 → 65	Moderate → Lower
D	Positive → Strong Positive	80% → 89%	68 → 55	Low → Very Low
E	Positive but Volatile → Neutral/Positive	85% → 87%	62 → 58	Low, but Delivery risk
✅ This gives you a forward-looking view:
Which clients need urgent corrective measures (A, B, E).
Which clients are safe but need nurturing (C, D).
Direct mapping from operational levers → sentiment trend → churn risk.
